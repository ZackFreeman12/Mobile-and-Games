<h2 align = center>Project Overview</h2>
Gamba is a Discord bot created for the purpose of entertaining users by letting them wager points
on dice games. Data persistence is achived by registering users in a database and storing their points
and other game stats like winning streaks and total wins. Gamba can be added to any Discord server, it
is recommended to give the bot its own text channel due to the quick games and users repeating commands
quickly.
